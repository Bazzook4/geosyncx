# How to Set Your Primary Timezone: Essential Guide for Remote Workers

**Master timezone management by setting your home timezone as the reference point for all time conversions.**

## Why You Need a Primary Timezone

When you're coordinating across multiple timezones, you need one reference point - your "home base" for time conversions. This is your **primary timezone**.

Think of it like your phone's home screen. Everything else is relative to it.

### Without a Primary Timezone
You're converting between random timezones:
- "What's 3 PM London in Tokyo time?"
- "What's 9 AM New York in Sydney time?"
- Mental gymnastics for every conversion

### With a Primary Timezone Set
All conversions flow from YOUR time:
- "I want to meet at 3 PM my time - what is that for everyone else?"
- One input, instant answers for all locations
- No mental math required

## What is a Primary Timezone in GeoSyncX?

Your primary timezone is:

1. **Your reference point** - The timezone you think in (usually where you live/work)
2. **Your conversion base** - When you pick "3 PM", that's 3 PM in YOUR primary timezone
3. **Your calendar timezone** - Meetings you schedule use this as the starting point

It's marked with a **green pin icon** and appears first in your timezone list.

## How to Set Your Primary Timezone

### Step 1: Add Your Timezone
If you haven't already:
1. Go to the "Timezones" tab in [GeoSyncX](https://www.geosyncx.com)
2. Search for your city (e.g., "Los Angeles", "London", "Mumbai")
3. Click to add it to your list

### Step 2: Click the Pin Icon
Find your timezone in the table and click the **green pin icon** (map pin symbol) next to it.

The timezone will:
- Move to the top of the list
- Show a green highlighted pin (indicating it's primary)
- Become the reference for all time conversions

### Step 3: Verify It's Set
You should see:
- Your timezone at the top of the table
- Green pin icon next to it
- Text below the time picker showing "Primary: [Your Timezone]"

Done! Now every time you enter a meeting time, it's in YOUR timezone.

## Changing Your Primary Timezone

Need to change it? Easy:

1. Click the pin icon next to ANY other timezone in your list
2. That timezone becomes the new primary
3. The old primary becomes a regular timezone (but stays in your list)

This is perfect for:
- **Digital nomads** who travel frequently
- **Relocated workers** who moved to a new timezone
- **Temporary assignments** in different locations

### Example: Traveling to a Conference
You live in New York (EST) but are attending a conference in San Francisco (PST) for a week.

**Before travel:** Primary = New York
**During conference:** Click pin on San Francisco → Primary = San Francisco
**After return:** Click pin on New York → Primary = New York again

Now when you schedule meetings during the conference, they're in Pacific time (where you are), not Eastern time (where you usually are).

## How Primary Timezone Affects Features

### 1. Time Conversion
When you enter "3:00 PM" in the time picker, that's 3 PM in your PRIMARY timezone. GeoSyncX converts it to all other timezones.

**Example:**
- Primary: Los Angeles (PST)
- You enter: 3:00 PM
- Results:
  - Los Angeles: 3:00 PM (primary)
  - New York: 6:00 PM
  - London: 11:00 PM
  - Mumbai: 4:30 AM (next day)

### 2. Meeting Scheduling
When you use the "Schedule this time" feature to create a Google Calendar event:
- Start time is in your primary timezone
- Calendar event is saved in UTC
- Attendees see it in THEIR local time

This prevents the classic mistake: "I created a meeting for 3 PM but it showed up as 3 PM London time instead of 3 PM my time!"

### 3. Best Meeting Time Finder
The "Best Meeting Time Finder" lists your primary timezone first in all recommendations. This makes it easy to quickly see "what time would this be for ME?"

### 4. Date Selection
When you pick a date, it's relative to your primary timezone. This matters because:
- "January 15" in Los Angeles is still "January 14" in parts of the Pacific
- The app ensures the date is correct for YOUR timezone

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Freelancer Working from Home
**Location:** Toronto, Canada
**Primary Timezone:** America/Toronto (EST)
**Other Timezones:** Client locations (Los Angeles, London, Sydney)

**How they use it:**
- Set Toronto as primary
- Enter available meeting times in EST
- Clients see converted times instantly
- Never worry about converting "their time" to "my time"

### Scenario 2: Remote Employee on a Global Team
**Location:** Austin, Texas
**Primary Timezone:** America/Chicago (CST)
**Other Timezones:** Teammates in SF, NYC, London, Bangalore

**How they use it:**
- Austin is primary
- Check current time across all locations
- When scheduling team meetings, enter time in CST
- Everyone's calendar shows correct local time

### Scenario 3: Digital Nomad
**Normally:** Lisbon, Portugal
**Currently:** Bali, Indonesia
**Primary Timezone:** Changes based on current location

**How they use it:**
- Set primary to current location (Bali)
- All conversions reflect "Bali time" for this period
- When moving to next location, update primary again
- Keep client timezones in the list (those don't change)

### Scenario 4: Manager with International Team
**Location:** San Francisco
**Primary Timezone:** America/Los_Angeles (PST)
**Other Timezones:** 6 direct reports across 5 timezones

**How they use it:**
- SF is primary
- See who's currently online (based on current time)
- Plan 1-on-1s by converting "3 PM my time" to their time
- Use Best Meeting Finder for team meetings

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Set It Once, Use It Always
After setting your primary timezone, you rarely need to change it. It's not something you toggle constantly - it's your HOME timezone.

### Tip 2: Primary ≠ Most Important
"Primary" doesn't mean most important. It means "reference point". Your client in London might be more important business-wise, but if YOU live in Los Angeles, LA is your primary.

### Tip 3: Check Before Scheduling
Always verify your primary timezone BEFORE scheduling important meetings:
1. Look at the text: "Primary: [Timezone]"
2. Confirm it's where YOU currently are
3. Then enter meeting time

This prevents embarrassing "I accidentally scheduled this in the wrong timezone" moments.

### Tip 4: Desktop + Mobile Sync
If you use GeoSyncX on both desktop and mobile:
- Your primary timezone is saved in browser local storage
- Different browsers = different saved state
- Quick fix: Set it once on each device/browser

### Tip 5: Bookmark the App
Since the primary timezone is saved automatically, you can:
- Bookmark GeoSyncX
- Open it anytime
- Your primary timezone and all saved timezones are still there
- No re-setup needed

## What Happens If You Don't Set a Primary?

GeoSyncX will:
- Use your browser's detected timezone as a fallback
- Show a message: "Set a primary zone"
- Still show current times for added timezones
- But time conversion feature won't work optimally

Bottom line: **Always set a primary timezone** for the best experience.

## Browser Timezone Detection

When you first open GeoSyncX, it automatically:
1. Detects your browser's timezone (from system settings)
2. Suggests it as your primary
3. You can accept or change it

This means most users start with the correct primary timezone without any manual setup.

### If Detection is Wrong
Sometimes browser detection is off (VPN use, misconfigured system clock, etc.). Fix it:
1. Search for your actual location
2. Click the pin icon to set it as primary
3. The correct timezone overrides the auto-detection
